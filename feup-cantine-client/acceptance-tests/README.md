# Instructions to run acceptance tests

1. The test **client.side** has to be imported to the selenium web browser extenstion.

2. After that, run all the tests and verify if the changes that were made don't interfer with the previous version.

3. Add more tests to verify the implemented features.

For more information on how to run the Acceptance Tests watch run-demo.mp4.

## Note

This tests were running on the CI/CD pipeline, but they were giving lots of problems. So, to not waste even more time testing the UI, we decided to follow this workflow.
