# Feup Cantine

This is a system that was developed within the scope of the LES course taught at [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/web_page.inicial).

## Main Objective

The main objective was to develop a system that would allow people associated with the university to make lunch or dinner reservations in the institution's canteens.

## The Development

During development there was a concern to comply with good software development practices. To this end the developlemnt team practiced CI/CD methodologies, unit testing, integration testing, acceptance testing, static code analysis, among others.

In addition to good development practices, we also seek to abstract the solution from hardware and software constraints using for that docker containers.

In terms of technologies, for the **api** development we used **SpringBoot**. **Angular** was used for **frontend** development.

## Demo

In the following video we show the looks and functionalities of the system.
